### ✅ **Completed So Far**
- ✅ Manual tuning of **learning rate** and **batch size**
- ✅ Comparison of models **with/without BatchNormalization and Dropout**
- ✅ Evaluated using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, **classification report**
- ✅ Explored performance of different ANN structures and callbacks
- ✅ Got hands-on with **EarlyStopping**

### ⏳ **Remaining for Today**
Here are key parts we can still cover (based on your earlier goals and enhancements I proposed):

#### 🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning Approaches
- [ ] Try **GridSearchCV** with `KerasClassifier` for binary classification
- [ ] Try **RandomSearch** using `keras_tuner`

#### 📉 Learning Rate Strategy
- [ ] Implement **Learning Rate Scheduler**
- [ ] Try **Warm-up + Scheduler combo** (e.g., warm-up + cosine decay)

#### 🧪 Weight Initialization
- [ ] Compare `he_normal`, `glorot_uniform`, etc. on model performance

#### 💾 Training Utilities
- [ ] Use **ModelCheckpoint** to store the best model
- [ ] Optional: visualize LR, loss, and other metrics over time

### 💡 Suggestion for Next Step
Let’s proceed with this sequence:
1. **Run GridSearchCV** for binary classification
2. Then move to **keras_tuner.RandomSearch**
3. After that, explore **LR scheduling + warm-up**
4. Optionally: initializer comparison + ModelCheckpoint if time permits

Shall we begin with **GridSearchCV using `KerasClassifier`**? I can set it up with a simple binary dataset like Breast Cancer (or another if you have in mind).
