Great question, Sumit! The **Adam optimizer** is widely used in deep learning models because it combines the benefits of two other popular optimization algorithms: **Adagrad** and **RMSProp**, making it efficient and adaptive. Let's break it down step by step:

---

### **What is Adam?**
Adam stands for **Adaptive Moment Estimation**. It adjusts the learning rate for each parameter (weight) dynamically during training, which leads to faster convergence and better results in many cases.

### **Why Use Adam?**
1. **Combines Momentum and Scaling:**
   - **Momentum:** Adam uses past gradients (first-order moments) to smooth out updates. This prevents oscillations in weight updates and helps in converging faster.
   - **Scaling:** Adam also uses the squared gradients (second-order moments) to scale the learning rate differently for each parameter. This means larger updates for infrequent features and smaller updates for frequent ones.

2. **Adaptive Learning Rates:**
   - Unlike fixed learning rates, Adam adapts the learning rate for each parameter during training. This is particularly useful for sparse data or when dealing with datasets with different feature scales.

3. **Efficient and Reliable:**
   - Adam works well with noisy gradients, sparse data, and non-stationary objectives. It's computationally efficient and requires minimal memory.

4. **Works "Out of the Box":**
   - You donâ€™t need to manually tune the learning rate as much as you do with other optimizers like SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent). The default parameters (`learning_rate=0.001, beta1=0.9, beta2=0.999`) work well for most tasks.

### **How It Works: Key Components**
- **Gradient (First Moment,  m_t ):**
  Adam calculates the exponentially weighted average of gradients.


  m_t = \beta_1 \cdot m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) \cdot g_t
  

 where  g_t  is the gradient at time step  t , and  \beta_1  controls the decay rate.

- **Squared Gradient (Second Moment,  v_t ):**
  It also calculates the exponentially weighted average of the squared gradients.


  v_t = \beta_2 \cdot v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) \cdot g_t^2
  

- **Bias Correction:**
  Since  m_t  and  v_t  are biased towards zero initially, Adam includes a correction step to normalize them:


  \hat{m}_t = \frac{m_t}{1 - \beta_1^t}, \quad \hat{v}_t = \frac{v_t}{1 - \beta_2^t}
  

- **Weight Update:**
  Finally, the weights are updated using:


  \theta_t = \theta_{t-1} - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon} \cdot \hat{m}_t
  

 where  \eta  is the learning rate, and  \epsilon  prevents division by zero.

### **Advantages of Adam**
- **Faster Convergence:** Works well even with large datasets and complex models.
- **Robust to Noisy Gradients:** Helps in scenarios like mini-batch gradient descent.
- **Handles Sparse Gradients:** Suitable for models with sparse features, e.g., natural language processing.
- **Default Parameters Work Well:** Minimal hyperparameter tuning required.

### **Why Adam for Fashion MNIST?**
1. **Quick Convergence:** The dataset is relatively small, and Adam speeds up training by adjusting learning rates dynamically.
2. **Complex Models:** Adam works well with deep models involving dense and dropout layers.
3. **Stability:** It handles noisy gradients efficiently, leading to stable and smooth loss reduction.
